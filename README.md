Random math questions for grade 4 student

This code is for my school project. I share my code here because of my friend request.
Feel free to use it whatever you want. give me some recognise if you're going to copy. :)
with my little knowledge about coding, it is very poorly optimised. Let me know if you can do better.

```
# Difficulty Level Explain #

Level 1: 2 digit plus and minus
Level 2: 3 digit plus and minus
Level 3: 4 digit plus and minus
Level 4: 5 digit plus and minus

Level 6: 4 digit times
Level 7: 5 digit times
Level 8: 3 digit division
Level 9: 4 digit division

Since the target is a grade 4 student, I have to make the division divisible
also, the code has no negative number in both question and answer.
